		        	<p>The 1947 Restaurant, located in Mangalore, is the first-ever restaurant, run and lead by women entirely and our hearts are overwhelmed with joy!
The first ever cafe in the Capital, that is run entirely by women. Pretty cool, right? From chefs to servers, this new restaurant is challenging quite a few norms. The co-founders love and appreciate the idea of women, stepping up and taking the lead at a time when basic human rights and equal job opportunities and wages are a huge problem. Keeping that in mind, they coined the name "1947 Restaurant" and have got a lot in store for women who not only come-in to dine, but work here as well. In addition to that, they have also started a campaign called 'She Can' which revolves around their merchandise and the collections from which will go to an NGO, that is dedicated towards welfare of women.   </p>
